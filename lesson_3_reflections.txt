When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working in a team, to share work as fast as possible and allow continuos work on the same project for more than one person. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might have worked on the project and introduced changes that you don't neccesarly would like to have introduced in your local version of code.
