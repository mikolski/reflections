When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working in a team, to share work as fast as possible and allow continuos work on the same project for more than one person. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Someone else might have worked on the project and introduced changes that you don't neccesarly would like to have introduced in your local version of code. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copied repositories "inside" GitHub, clones are repositories copied between to local machines, or local machine and GitHub, branches are parts of repository. 

	If I would like to copy somebody's else repository to work on it without permision to change his repository I could use forking. To copy into my own machine I could clone repository from GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

That it's posible to compare local version with last known remote version of file without neccecity of merging them straight away.
