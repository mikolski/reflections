 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is being created, changing the prefered directory into repository, though no commit is being made. You've got to make the first commit yourself.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a medium stage. There doesn't have to be all of files from  directory. It's a preparational stage.
It offers better control.
