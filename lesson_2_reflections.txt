 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is being created, changing the prefered directory into repository, though no commit is being made. You've got to make the first commit yourself.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a medium stage. There doesn't have to be all of files from  directory. It's a preparational stage.
It offers better control. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I may compare staging area to working directory...

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

I can imagine tons of situations like that. Basically trying new stuff, changing direction in which you would like to develop your program, etc. You can probably work on two different directions almost simultaneously using branches.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It's much easier to find yourself in situation, it's getting obvious what is parent of what, etc.
